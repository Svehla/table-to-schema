node_modules

# Introduction

webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.


**TL; DR**

* Bundles both [CommonJs](http://www.commonjs.org/specs/modules/1.0/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).
* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
* Dependencies are resolved during compilation reducing the runtime size.
* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. coffeescript to JavaScript, handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.
